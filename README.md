# CSS Columns Gutenberg block plugin for Wordpress 

This is a WordPress plugin which adds a Gutenberg block allowing to wrap some Gutenberg content (including any other blocks) into multiple autoflowing columns (also known as CSS columns).

Forked and modified based on an [example Gutenberg wrapper block WP plugin](https://github.com/liip/wrapper-block-example-wp-plugin) made by Liip AG. See [his blog post](https://www.liip.ch/en/blog/writing-a-wrapper-block-for-gutenberg-in-wordpress).

## Usage

Open a Gutenberg enabled page in WP admin, pick Auto Columns block, adjust number of columns with the slider in the block settings (sidebar to the right).
